# San Francisco Housing Cost Analysis

# In this assignment, you will perform fundamental analysis for the San Francisco housing market
#  to allow potential real estate investors to choose rental investment properties.

# Average Housing Costs in San Francisco Per Year

# In this section, you will calculate the average monthly rent and 
# the average price per square foot for each year. 
# An investor may wish to better understand the sales price of the 
# rental property over time. For example, a customer will want to know 
# if they should expect an increase or decrease in the property 
# value over time so they can determine how long to hold the rental property. 
# Plot the results as two line charts.

# Optional challenge: Plot each line chart in a different color.

# Create two line charts, one to plot the average sale price per square foot and another for average montly rent

# Average Prices by Neighborhood

# In this section, you will use hvplot to create two interactive visulizations 
# of average prices with a dropdown selector for the neighborhood. 
# The first visualization will be a line plot showing the trend of average 
# price per square foot over time for each neighborhood. 
# The second will be a line plot showing the trend of average montly rent over time for each neighborhood.

# Hint: It will be easier to create a new DataFrame from 
# grouping the data and calculating the mean prices for each year and neighborhood


#%%

# Group by year and neighborhood and then create a new dataframe of the mean values

# want to combine these two df.s
# avg_price_sqr_ft = mean_housing_units_year_all["sale_price_sqr_foot"]
# avg_monthly_rent = mean_housing_units_year_all["gross_rent"]

# note - answer has index iterated, different from year values
